                <p>
                    Start planning early: make a checklist, declutter, and pack room by
                    room. Label boxes clearly and keep important documents safe.

                <h2>11. Understand Cargo Transport</h2>
                <p>
                    Cargo transport is the backbone of global trade. It involves moving
                    large shipments of goods using trucks, trains, ships, or airplanes.
                    Efficient cargo management ensures goods arrive on time, reduces
                    costs, and minimizes damage. Innovations like GPS tracking,
                    automated warehouses, and real-time monitoring are transforming the
                    cargo industry.

                <h2>12. Parcel Delivery Insights</h2>
                <p>
                    Parcel delivery focuses on smaller shipments, especially for
                    e-commerce and individual customers. Fast, reliable delivery depends
                    on smart logistics, route optimization, and tracking systems. Modern
                    parcel services aim to provide convenience, speed, and transparency
                    for customers worldwide.
